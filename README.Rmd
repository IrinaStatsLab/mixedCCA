# mixedCCA: sparse CCA for data of mixed types

The R package `mixedCCA` is to apply sparse CCA on the data of mixed types: continuous, binary or zero-inflated (truncated continuous). The methods are described in [Sparse semiparametric canonical correlation analysis for data of mixed types] by Yoon, Carroll and Gaynanova (2018+).


## Installation

```{install}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("irinagain/mixedCCA")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
